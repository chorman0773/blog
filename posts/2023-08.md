## Intro to XLang

[XLang](https://lccc.lcdev.xyz/xlang) is the intermediate architectuer and intermediate representation language used by the [LCCC](https://github.com/lccc-project/lccc) project for lowering and optimizing programs from a source language to machine code.

It is a stack based language that was originally designed in early 2020 by myself as part of the LCCC project, though it has undergone some revisions since.

## General Concepts

XLang is a strict stack-base architecture - within a function, all instructions, also referred to as expressions, will pop a certain number of input values from a stack, perform some operation, and push each output value back to the same stack. There is no random access to the stack (though the `pivot` instruction offers the ability to move values up by popping off two groups then pushing them in the opposite order), and the stack cannot be addressed.
You also cannot modify an entry on the stack, but would rather have to pop the value and then push the new value.

Local variables are offered when mutable, addressible memory is required.

There are two kinds of values on the stack: rvalues and lvalues. An rvalue is a simple value, such as `0`, `512`, `2.71828`, a pointer, or a composite value like a struct.
An lvalue is a synthetic value that designates some part of memory, known as an object.

Computations are performed on rvalues, while lvalues must be read or written to.

## An Example, the Tiny language lowered to XLang

The [Tiny Language](https://github.com/chorman0773/TinyCompiler/blob/main/lang-spec/README.md) is a simple language that was introduced in a compilers course at my university.
While the course only referred to the lexical and syntatic grammar of the language, I have personally expanded it to include semantic analysis and codegen (to JVM bytecode), and even added a few extensions.

The grammar of the language is, in ABNF:

```abnf

QUOTE := %x22

STRING_CHAR := %x01-09 \ %x0B-0C \ %x0E-21 \  %x23-7F \ %x80-D7FF \ %xE000-10FFFF

string-literal := <QUOTE> [*<STRING_CHAR>] <QUOTE>

DIGIT := %x30-39

number-literal := *<digit>["." *<digit>]

literal := <number-literal> / <string-literal>

identifier := <XID_Start>[*<XID_Part>]

file := *<method-decl>

method-decl := <type> ["MAIN"] <identifier> "(" <param-list> ")" <block>

type := "INT" / "STRING" / "REAL"

param-list := [<param> / (<param> "," <param-list>)]

param := <type> <identifier>

block := "BEGIN" [*<statement>] "END"

statement := <declaration> / <assignment> / <read> / <write> / <if> / <block> / <return>

declaration := <type> <identifier> [":=" <expression>] ";"
assignment := <identifier> ":=" <expression> ";"
read := "READ" "(" <identifier> "," <string-literal> ")" ";"
write := "WRITE" "(" <expression> "," <string-literal> ")" ";"
if := "IF" "(" <bool-expression> ")" <statement> ["ELSE" <statement>]
return := "RETURN" <expression> ";"

bool-expression := (<expression> ("==" / "!=") <expression>)
```

The semantics of Tiny are fairly simple: READ reads from a named file, and WRITE writes to it. `IF` takes one branch if a value evaluates to true, and another if it evaluates to false.
The function marked `MAIN` is run at startup.

Using this, we can write a few test programs, taken from a [full compiler](https://github.com/chorman0773/TinyCompiler), and explore how they could be translated to XLang IR.

For the compilation of these tests, I have elected to use a basic variation of the [Itanium Name Mangling](https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#mangling) scheme. `INT`, being a 32-bit integer is encoded as `i`, `REAL` as `d`, and `STRING` as u6string

### test1 - A fairly basic example

```
INT f0(REAL x)
BEGIN
    RETURN x;
END
```


In a basic xlang lowering, we can translate the above to:
```
public function _ZN5test12f0Ed(float(64)) -> int(32){
    convert weak int(32)
    exit 1
}
```

A very simple program with a very simple translation - convert the input value to a 32-bit integer, then return it.

To show the behaviour of the program, in loose terms, to validate that the lowering is correct, we can add stack type annotations in comments, placed in square brackets, that show the state of the current value stack that xlang sees after each expression. (The annotations are not processed by the compiler, and are simply added for ease of reading)

```
public functon _ZN5test12f0Ed(float(64)) -> int(32){
       // [float(64)]
       convert weak int(32) // [int(32)]
       exit 1
}
```

Function parameters are placed on the stack in their appropriate order and are already there when the function begins execution.
`convert weak int(32)` then pops a value off the stack, in this case `float(64)`, performs a conversion, and pushes the result, in this case `int(32)`.

`exit 1` then pops 1 value off the stack and "exits" (that is, returns from) the current function with that popped value, which is the return value.

### test2 - A simple executable program


```
INT MAIN main() BEGIN
   INT x;
   READ(x,"test-stdin");
   WRITE(x,"test-stdout");
END
```

This needs some more work, and we need some dependencies for the `READ` and `WRITE` statements, as well as for creating strings (an extension allows us to ). We're also going to lower the `MAIN` function in two steps: one step compiling the function directly, and a second generating a call stub that does some initialization, calls the main function, and then returns.
The definitions of the `__tiny_read_INT`, `__tiny_write_INT`, `__tiny_const_string`, `__tiny_rt_init`, and `__tiny_rt_cleanup` are left as an implementation-detail and are largely irrelevant for this program:

```
public function __tiny_read_INT(*void()) -> int(32);
public function __tiny_write_INT(int(32), *void());

public function __tiny_const_string(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void();
public function __tiny_rt_init();
public function __tiny_rt_cleanup();

public function _ZN5test24mainEv() -> int(32){
    const global_address function(*void())->int(32) __tiny_read_INT
    const global_address function(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void() __tiny_const_string
    const *char(8) "test-stdin\n"
    derive *const readonly nonnull char(8) nop
    call function(*const readonly nonnull char(8))->*void()
    call function(*void())->int(32)
    const global_address function(int(32),*void()) __tiny_write_INT
    pivot 1 1
    const global_address function(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void() __tiny_const_string
    const *char(8) "test-stdin\n"
    derive *const readonly nonnull char(8) nop
    call function(*const readonly nonnull char(8))->*void()
    call function(int(32),*void())
    const int(32) 0
    exit 1
}

public function main() -> int(32){
    const global_address function() __tiny_rt_init
    call function()
    const global_address function()->int(32) _ZN5test24mainEv
    call function()->int(32)
    const global_address function() __tiny_rt_cleanup
    call function()
    exit 1
}
```

Adding stack type annotations, we generating

```
public function __tiny_read_INT(*void()) -> int(32);
public function __tiny_write_INT(int(32), *void());

public function __tiny_const_string(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void();
public function __tiny_rt_init();
public function __tiny_rt_cleanup();

public function _ZN5test24mainEv() -> int(32){
    // []
    const global_address function(*void())->int(32) __tiny_read_INT // [*function(*void())->int(32)]
    const global_address function(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void() __tiny_const_string // [*function(*void())->int(32), *function(*const readonly nonnull char(8))->void()]
    const *char(8) "test-stdin\n" // [*function(*void())->int(32), *function(*const readonly nonnull char(8))->void(), *char(8)]
    derive *const readonly nonnull char(8) // [*function(*void())->int(32), *unction(*const readonly nonnull char(8))->void(), *const readonly nonnull char(8)]
    call function(*const readonly nonnull char(8))->*void() // [*function(*void())->int(32), *void()]
    call function(*void())->int(32) // [int(32)]
    const global_address function(int(32),*void()) __tiny_write_INT // [int(32), *function(int(32),*void())]
    pivot 1 1 // [*function(int(32),*void()), int(32)]
    const global_address function(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void() __tiny_const_string // [*function(int(32),*void()), int(32), *function(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void()]
    const *char(8) "test-stdin\n" // [*function(int(32),*void()), int(32), *function(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void(), *char(8)]
    derive *const readonly nonnull char(8) // [*function(int(32),*void()), int(32), *function(*const readonly nonnull char(8)) -> *void(), *const readonly nonnull char(8)]
    call function(*const readonly nonnull char(8))->*void() // [*function(int(32),*void()), int(32), *void()]
    call function(int(32),*void()) // []
    const int(32) 0 // [int(32)]
    exit 1
}

public function main() -> int(32){
    const global_address function() __tiny_rt_init // [*function()]
    call function() // []
    const global_address function()->int(32) _ZN5test24mainEv // [*function() -> int(32)]
    call function()->int(32) // [int(32)]
    const global_address function() __tiny_rt_cleanup // [int(32), *function()]
    call function() // [int(32)]
    exit 1
}
